.TH HSH "1" "30 August 2018" "v1"
.SH NAME
.B hsh
- Command-line interpreter (shell)
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include "shell.h"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B hsh
is a custom command-line inerpreter. The user's input will be taken, parsed, then executed if found in one of the directories in PATH. This shell is limited to commands found in either one of the PATH directories and also limited to certain shell builtins (env and exit). We have not handled piped commands, redirections, or any advanced tasks.
.SS Invocation
The shell will usually be ran in
.I interactive
mode by reading input from the keyboard, but this shell also supports
.I non-interactive
mode. In a
.I non-interactive
mode, users are able to pipe a command into the shell or execute a shell script in
.B hsh.
In this way, the shell will only open to execute the command then immediately close.
.SS Supported Commands
.sp
ls
.I [[flags]...[arguments]]
      lists files in the current directory using flags entered by user
.sp
pwd
      prints working directory
.sp
cat
.I [[flag] [file ...]]
      read and writes files to standard output and displays certains formats
      depending on flag entered by user
.sp
echo
.I [arguments]
      writes argument(s) that the user enters to standard ouput then prints
      a newline
.SS Suported Builtins
.sp
env
      prints enviroment variables
.sp
exit
      exits out of
.B hsh
and returns to user's original shell
.SH RETURN VALUE
.B hsh
will return zero (0) upon success, or any other number which represents failure or error
